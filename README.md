Chris Hough: graphic designer and illustrator

I am a soon to graduate student who currently hangs my hat in the city of Ottawa. I started adulthood in a fine arts program, then followed up with a (brief) career in education. Now I find myself studying design. Much like Goldilocks, I found the third option to be just right.
