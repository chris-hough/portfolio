      <p class="push-1-2">Nice to meet you! I am a graphic designer studying at Algonquin College
who specializes in branding and illustration. I especially enjoy creating logos.
I’m a team player, too. It’s surprising just how much
my time working as an educator has prepared me for a career in design.
Strong communication skills and the ability to adapt to whatever comes your
way make all the difference, whether you’re working with a design team or a
gaggle of kindergarteners armed with finger paint.</p>
