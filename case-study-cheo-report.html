      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">This project started with a rigorous research process to ensure that CHEO's principles were authentically represented with this report. A moodboard and numerous layout sketches established a theme centred on CHEO's goal of letting kids focus on being kids, and not the ailment that led them to the hospital in the first place.</p>
      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">All illustrations were made for this report, and all photography is sourced from stock sites. A calming pastel green was chosen to both signify medical scrubs, and growth and vitality of youth. </p>
