      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">A process in all its stages was to be depicted in this project. Isometric illustrations tend to lean towards pixel art and hard lines, which can feel very static. I wanted to challenge myself by choosing organic forms that still adhered to the grid. </p>
      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">The characters were sketched first in order to establish a graphic style. The treehouse was designed on a grid, with consideration given as to how the process of its construction could best be shown. The colour palette is meant to renforce the whimsical and lighthearted subject matter. </p>
