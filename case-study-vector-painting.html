      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">This project was a way of practicing with an unfamiliar technique. Most of my work in Illustrator prior to this was limited to clean lines and relatively flat colours. Most of the brushes used here are custom-made. The challenge here was to build up layers of colour and texture without letting the file size become unmangeable.</p>
      <p class=" unit xs-1 l-1-2 push">Choosing the subject for the illustration started with an urge to draw a tangle of hair with my newly created brushes. Inspired by the song <i>Ride a White Swan</i> by T.Rex, the end result was a colourful druid with a fantastic beard. </p>
